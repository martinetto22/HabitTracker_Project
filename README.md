# HabitTracker_Project
To achieve any objective, one must set habits that will give him the necessary discipline to achieve his goals.
The project consists of a program that records the objectives that a user has set for himself. In each of his objectives, the user should define the habits necessary to achieve his goal. The habits have been divided into "daily habits" and "weekly habits".

The program will keep track of the days that the daily habits have been fulfilled (the same with the weekly habits) and will display simple statistics that will allow a better analysis of the user's behavior (to facilitate its improvement).
